The Magento cache can speed up your system, but it has it's pittfalls. One of them being that the lookup can 
actually slow down your system if you have a lot of entries. A periodic cleanup can do wonders in that case. From this 
need I created this module that currently let's you set up two cronjobs from the admin area to manage your cache entries.

You can set a cronjob to cleanup specific cache tags. Useful if you have a security scan running that leaves your cache
cluttered with thousands of entries.

Then there is a cronjob that removes entries that have expired, something that Magento does not bother to do.
